Hello, my name is Adam Richardson and on this first post of my blog I wanted to discuss how it was put together. This site is a static site made using a variety of tools but most importantly <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/">Go Web Templates</a> and <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML markup</a>. My goal was to build a minimal blog that allows me to easily make posts.

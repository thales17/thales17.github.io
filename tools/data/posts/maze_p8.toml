If there are no unvisited cells then backtrack until you find one. I artificially slowed the algorithm down to only draw one cell per frame so you can see the computer drawing out the maze. This project was inspired by this awesome One Lone Coder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y37-gB83HKE">video</a>."""
